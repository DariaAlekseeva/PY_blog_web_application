# Flask blog web application

Flask is a Python web framework. In its simplest terms, it maps URLs that users can type in their browsers to Python functions.

In this Flask App, we'll be:

* Displaying HTML content;
* Allowing users to submit a form; and
* Saving things to an in-memory database.
* The app takes the form of a simple blog applicationâ€”where a user can add new posts to our blog.
